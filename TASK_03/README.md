# Car Price Prediction Readme

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting car prices using a dataset of used cars. The project covers various stages, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and results interpretation.

## Files

- **car_price_prediction.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the entire code for the project.
- **car data.csv:** Dataset used for training and evaluation.

## Project Structure

1. **Importing Important Modules and Reading the Data:**
   - Utilized modules like NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn for data analysis and machine learning.
   - Loaded the dataset ('car data.csv') for further exploration.

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Checked the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
   - Utilized descriptive statistics and visualizations to analyze the data.
   - Verified the absence of missing values in the dataset.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Applied feature scaling to standardize numerical features.
   - Utilized one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format.
   - Dropped unnecessary columns and transformed the dataset.

4. **Data Splitting:**
   - Divided the dataset into training, validation, and test sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn.

5. **Model Training:**
   - Employed the RandomForestRegressor model for predicting car prices.
   - Trained the model using the training set.

6. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluated the model's performance on the validation set using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Conducted a grid search to optimize hyperparameters for the RandomForestRegressor model.

8. **Prediction:**
   - Applied the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
   - Assessed the model's performance on the test set using evaluation metrics.

9. **Results Interpretation:**
   - Analyzed feature importances to understand the key factors influencing car prices.

10. **Documentation and Reporting:**
    - Summarized the entire process, including data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results interpretation.
    - Provided an overview of key metrics and insights gained from the analysis.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:

   ```
   pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `car_price_prediction.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.

3. Run the cells in sequential order to execute the code step by step.

4. The notebook provides explanations and comments to guide you through each stage of the project.

Feel free to explore, modify, and adapt the code for your own projects. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please create an issue in the repository.
